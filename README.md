Sample mood visualization with a twist.
You can influence mood by various actions, the twist is that happy objects might invite new objects and unhappy objects leave.

Chart on the top shows mood distribution.

Built on [D3.js](http://d3js.org) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)

Features
--------

- Path transition for the face (Best seen when there is less than handful of objects on screen)
- Snake path distribution for nicer effect when removing and adding new objects.
